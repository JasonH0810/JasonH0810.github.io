Some records and thinking about "Intriguing properties of neural networks"

Abstract
======
Mainly report two properties of DNN:
- No distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units.-> Problem Space.
- the input-output mappings of DNN are fairly discontinuous.-> Misclassify an image by perturbation. Same perturbation causes different network to misclaasify the same input.

Introduction
======
The semantic meaning of individual units:
